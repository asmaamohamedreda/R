# Assignment 1: R Programming - DNA Sequences and Physics Application

## Section 1: Working with DNA Sequences (Variables & Vectors)

### Q1. For a short segment of artificial DNA sequence data:

Sequence 1: `"AGTCCG"`

Sequence 2: `"CGTAAA"`

**1.a.** Create two variables, `seq1` and `seq2`, to store the given DNA sequences.

**1.b.** Combine these two sequences into a single sequence and store it in a new variable called `combined_seq`.

**1.c.** Create a vector `all_seqs` that contains both original sequences as its elements.

### Q2. Assume we are working with the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):
Represented as different alleles at specific positions:

- SNP1: A, T
- SNP2: C, G
- SNP3: G, A
- SNP4: T, C

**Task:** Create four variables: `snp1`, `snp2`, `snp3`, and `snp4`. Each variable should store a vector representing the alleles for that SNP.

### Q3. If you have the MCL1 gene with the following sequence:

```
atcttataataataggaggagcccccaggagannnnnnnnnnnnnnnuaa
```

**a.** Clean this sequence: convert to uppercase and remove ambiguous nucleotides (e.g., `n`).

**b.** Extract the start and stop codons from this sequence.

**c.** Count how many nucleotides are in the MCL1 gene before and after cleaning.

**d.** Get the complementary strand for the cleaned MCL1 gene and transcribe it to RNA.

## Section 2: Kinematics in R - Solving for Acceleration

The equation for displacement in physics is:

```
s = ut + 1/2 * a * t^2
```

Rearranged to solve for acceleration `a`:

```
a = 2 * (s - u * t) / t^2
```

### Define variables and calculate the value of `a` in R:

```r
# Initial values
u <- 10    # initial velocity in m/s
t <- 5     # time in seconds
s <- 200   # displacement in meters

# Compute acceleration
a <- (2 * (s - u * t)) / (t^2)

# Output the result
cat("The acceleration is:", a, "m/s^2\n")
```

Expected Output:
```
The acceleration is: 4 m/s^2
```
