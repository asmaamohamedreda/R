# Programming with R: Combining For Loops and Conditional Statements

This notebook provides examples of `for` loops and conditional statements in R, focusing on common scenarios like filtering data, iterating through sequences, and working with data frames.

## Basics of For Loops in R

### Printing Numbers from 1 to 100
```R
for (i in 1:100) {
  print(i)
}
```

---

### Printing Even Numbers Between 2 and 100
```R
for (i in seq(2, 100, 2)) {
  print(i)
}
```

---

### Iterating Over a Vector of Names
```R
names = c("Asmaa", Tasneem", "Saif", "Youssef", "Mohamed", "Yassine")
for (name in names) {
  print(name)
}
```

Accessing elements by index:
```R
for (i in 1:length(names)) {
  print(names[i])
}
```

## Storing Values in Vectors Using For Loops

### Example 1: Simple Storage
```R
a = c()
for (i in 1:10) {
  a[i] = i
}
a
```

### Example 2: Appending to a Vector
```R
a = c()
for (i in 1:20) {
  a = c(a, i)
}
a
```

## Iterating and Storing Squares of Numbers

### Solution 1: Combining Values and Squares
```R
a = c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  a = c(a, i, i^2)
}
a
```

### Solution 2: Storing Values and Squares Separately
```R
x1 = c()
x2 = c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  x1 = c(x1, i)
  x2 = c(x2, i^2)
}
x1
x2
```

## For Loops with Conditional Statements

### Filtering Even and Odd Numbers
Print even numbers from 1 to 10:
```R
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    cat(i, "even number", "\n")
  }
}
```

Print odd numbers from 1 to 10:
```R
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 != 0) {
    cat(i, "odd number", "\n")
  }
}
```

---

### Storing Filtered Values
Store even numbers in a vector:
```R
a = c()
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    a = c(a, i)
  }
}
a
```

Demonstrating NA assignment:
```R
x = c()
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    x[i] = i
  }
}
x
```

---

## Summation with For Loops
```R
summation = 0
for (i in 1:5) {
  summation = summation + i
  print(summation)
}
summation
```

---

## Working with Data Frames

### Printing Specific Columns
Printing `gene_name` and `logFC` values:
```R
df <- read.csv("CleanRes.csv")

for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  genes = df[i, "gene_name"]
  logFCC = df[i, "logFC"]
  print(paste("Genes", genes, "LogFoldChange", logFCC))
}
```

---

### Storing Filtered Data
Store `gene_name` and `logFC` values in a vector:
```R
a = c()
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  genes = df[i, "gene_name"]
  logFCC = df[i, "logFC"]
  a = c(a, genes, logFCC)
}
head(a)
```

Using `dplyr` for similar tasks:
```R
library(dplyr)

df %>% 
  select(gene_name, logFC) %>% 
  head(3)
```

---

### Counting Significant Genes
Counting genes with `adj.P.Val < 0.05`:
```R
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  adj_P_Val = df[i, "adj.P.Val"]
  if (adj_P_Val < 0.05) {
    count = count + 1
  }
}
count
```

Storing names of significant genes:
```R
count = 0
a = c()
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  if (df$adj.P.Val[i] < 0.05) {
    count = count + 1
    a = c(a, df[i, "gene_name"])
  }
}
count
a
```

## Conclusion
This notebook illustrates the versatility of `for` loops in R, from basic iterations to complex filtering and data manipulation. Combined with conditional statements, `for` loops are a powerful tool for data processing and analysis.
