## Load Required Library
```r
library(reader)
```

---

## Import and Process Data
```r
exp <- read.delim("Path", row.names=1)

rownames(df) = df$...1
genes = df$...1
df = df[-1]
rownames(df) = genes
```

---

## Explore the Data
```r
dim(exp)
View(exp)
range(exp)
summary(exp)
names(exp)
head(exp, n=2)
tail(exp, n=4)

any(is.na(exp))
```

## Questions:
1. Calculate the average expression (`avg.exp`) and standard deviation (`SD`) for the dataset.
2. Identify the top 100 upregulated and downregulated genes based on average expression and standard deviation.

---

## Calculations
### Compute Average Expression and Standard Deviation
```r
avg.exp = rowMeans(exp)
gene_means = apply(exp, 1, mean)     # 1 for Rows, 2 for Columns
gene_SD = apply(exp, 1, sd)

exp = cbind(exp, avg.exp, gene_means, gene_SD)
```

---

### Sort and Identify Upregulated and Downregulated Genes
```r
exp.Downregulated = exp[order(exp$avg.exp), ]
exp.Upregulaed = exp[order(exp$avg.exp, decreasing = T), ]

exp.upregulated.SD = exp[order(exp$gene_SD, decreasing = T), ]
```

#### Extract Top 100 Genes
```r
Top100Ups = head(exp.Upregulaed, n=100)
Top100Ups_1 = exp.Upregulaed[1:100, ]

Top100Downs = head(exp.Downregulated, n=100)
Top100Downs_1 = exp.Downregulated[1:100, ]
```

---

## Save Top 100 Genes
```r
write.csv(Top100Ups, file = "Top100Ups.csv")
Top100Ups = read.csv("Top100Ups.csv", row.names = 1)

Top100UpsGeneNames = rownames(Top100Ups)
Top100UpsGeneNames

Top100DownsGeneNames = rownames(Top100Downs)
Top100DownsGeneNames
```

---

## Visualize the Data
### Histogram of Average Expression
```r
hist(exp$avg.exp, 
     main= "Average Expression", 
     xlab = "Mean Expression level")
```

### Histogram of Standard Deviation
```r
hist(exp$gene_SD, 
     main = "Standard Deviation for all Genes in exp", 
     xlab = "SD")
```

### Boxplot of Expression Data
```r
boxplot(exp, 
        main = "Boxplot for exp Data", 
        las = 2)
```
